This project is a HTML chatbot web app created using the Streamlit library where users upload a HTML file, and the chatbot instantly answers
questions about its content, making it a valuable tool for accessing information within text-based HTML documents. It uses various NLP
techniques of the LangChain library by storing data into a vector store and efficiently retrieving data from it to provide accurate responses through
data queries using Open AIâ€™s LLM.
